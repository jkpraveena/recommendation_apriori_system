**Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm**

This project implements the Apriori Algorithm for Market Basket Analysis to extract useful association rules from a transactional dataset. It provides insights into customer purchase behavior, which can be used to design effective marketing strategies like cross-selling or promotions.

**Features**

	•	Processes transactional data to identify frequent itemsets and their relationships.
	•	Generates association rules with user-defined support, confidence, and lift thresholds.
	•	Provides a ranked visualization of the strongest association rules.

**Technologies Used**

	•	Python: For data preprocessing and implementation.
	•	Apyori Library: For extracting association rules.
	•	Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
	•	Matplotlib: For potential visualizations.

**Dataset**

The dataset used is Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv, containing 7501 transactions, with each row representing items purchased together.

How to Run the Code

	1.	Install Required Libraries
Install the Apyori library if not already installed:

pip install apyori


	2.	Download the Dataset
Save the Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv file in the same directory as the script.
	3.	Execute the Script
Run the Python script using any Python IDE or terminal.
	4.	View Results
	•	The top 10 association rules will be displayed with their left-hand side, right-hand side, support, confidence, and lift.

**Sample Results**

The results include association rules in the following format:

Left Hand Side	Right Hand Side	Support	Confidence	Lift
Item A	Item B	0.0045	0.8	3.2

These rules help identify relationships between items frequently bought together.

**Customization**

	•	Modify the minimum support, confidence, lift, and length in the apriori function to suit your dataset and use case:

rules = apriori(
    transactions=transactions,
    min_support=0.003,
    min_confidence=0.2,
    min_lift=3,
    min_length=2,
    max_length=2
)

**Future Enhancements**

	•	Add visualization of association rules using libraries like NetworkX or seaborn.
	•	Experiment with different datasets and thresholds to generate more insights.
	•	Extend the analysis to include multi-level itemsets.
